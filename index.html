                        Hi their, my name is carlos and I like to explore, I also like to get lost, Well... sometimes, it really depends where, but I also like to learn, it makes me feel like I am progressing, even if sometimes it can be a bit fustrating, but persistence is key to overcome any situation. I can say a lot of things about me... but then I dont want people to get the idea that I am narcisist, I can assume that typing this you may learn a few things about me. But why not get to know each other the old fashion way, I am not saying I am old fashion, but I feel like one can convey sarcasm and tone when they are talking right infront of one another.
